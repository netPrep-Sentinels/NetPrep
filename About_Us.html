              <p>Hello my name is Ashley Gilmore, I am a junior at UTEP studying computer science. This project has been a major learning experience, as I had little to no experience with coding websites.<br> However working in the designs to be implemented was more fun than I had thought it would be. talking through ideas and customizing them as we worked really made the project feel collaborative, and fun.<br> In the future I would love to work on more projects like this one, or even turn this project into something bigger.</p>

              <p>Hello I am Joe Vega, studying computer science as a Junior at UTEP. After becoming interested in web design I decided to pursue learning how to make one myself.<br> For this hackathon I paired with a team of my friends to bring one of my ideas to life. In the future I wish to continue developing websites with my team.<br>-Steve Jobs

I am a Computer Science major in hopes to become a successful software engineer.<br>  While doing this project I had a lot of fun and wanted to commit into something fun and creative that can improve student studying and organization. I had a lot of fun and am excited on my CS journey!</p>

            <p>The project just came out of the blue and it would be an understatement to say that we were not prepared. However, with our tenacity, we were able to get a work site that accomplished everything we wanted for the competition.<br> While it was unfortunate that I could not help with most of the coding of the website due to family matters, I was able to assist in the development of the ideas and presentation of our project.<br> All in all, I am really happy at what we were able to accomplish and hope that on our next adventure will be just as fruitful.</p>
